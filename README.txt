Tube numbers >2 are additional duplicate samples a few owners contributed
Negative controls are indicated in the SampleID2 column. Three types, will need to do some custom parsing.
Group defines epileptic or not, but is blinded as A/B.


Attached is the spreadsheet with the data from the study dogs included.  We have added columns for the dogs name, the household (denoted by a number), the study group (epileptic versus control, denoted with A and B) and the treatment group (whether the epileptic dog in the pair was on phenobarbital or was drug naive). 

A couple of things to point out:
There are a couple of households (17 and 26) that contributed samples from two pairs of dogs. so there are 4 rows listed for these households  with 4 different dog names.
There are a couple of owners who got a little overzealous in their sample collection(!), and sent us additional tubes of fecal material.  We had all of these analyzed - the rows that include the extra samples are highlighted in grey.  
With respect to the treatment group - there have been a couple of recent studies that have evaluated the fecal microbiome in epileptic dogs over time in which phenobarbital was not shown to alter the fecal microbiome.   We had originally planned to analyze the phenobarbital households and the drug naive households separately, but in light of this I think it would be valuable to look at the groups separately but also analyze all of the households together irrespective of drug treatment status.
